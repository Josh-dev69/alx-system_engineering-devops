- What is an API: An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules and
  tools that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.
  It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and
  exchange information. APIs are used to enable the integration of different software
  systems, allowing them to work together and share data.
  APIs play a crucial role in modern software development, facilitating the integration
  of different services, systems, and platforms. They are fundamental to building web
  applications, mobile apps, and other software solutions that leverage the capabilities
  of external services or platforms.
